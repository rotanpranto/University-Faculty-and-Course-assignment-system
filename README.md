# University-Faculty-and-Course-assignment-system

The Course Section Allocation System is a new software application that helps educational institutions assign courses to faculty members. The system replaces manual processes and interfaces with existing student information systems and user authentication systems. It generates schedules based on business rules and generates reports and class routines based on faculty and course schedules. The system is a standalone application that exports data to other systems as needed.

Product Functions
The Course Section Allocation System must be able to perform the following major functions:
### 1.
Allow administrators to input and manage course information, including course name, room number. number of credits, section, day and times.
Allow administrators to input and manage faculty information, including faculty name, designation, email, EXT, room number, department, mobile number and maximum number of credits that can be assigned.
Generate schedules based on business rules, such as not assigning more than 11 credits to a faculty member and not assigning multiple classes in the same slot for a particular faculty member.
Generate reports based on faculty and course schedules, including faculty-wise, course wise, parallel course-wise, date-wise and room-wise schedules.
Interface with existing student information systems to ensure that schedules are accurate and up-to-date.
Interface with user authentication and authorization systems to ensure secure access to the application.
Export data to other systems as needed.

Software Components
The web-based application will be built using the MERN stack, which includes the following software components:

MongoDB (version 4.4 or later) as the database management system
Express.js (version 4.x or later) as the web application framework
React.js (version 17.x or later) as the front-end JavaScript library
Node.js (version 14.x or later) as the server-side JavaScript runtime environment
